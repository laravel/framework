# debounce

  Useful for implementing behavior that should only happen after a repeated
  action has completed.

## Installation

    $ component install component/debounce

  Or in node:

    $ npm install debounce

## Example

```js
var debounce = require('debounce');
window.onresize = debounce(resize, 200);

function resize(e) {
  console.log('height', window.innerHeight);
  console.log('width', window.innerWidth);
}
```

To later clear the timer and cancel currently scheduled executions:
```
window.onresize.clear();
```

To execute any pending invocations and reset the timer:
```
window.onresize.flush();
```

## API

### debounce(fn, wait, [ immediate || false ])

  Creates and returns a new debounced version of the passed function that
  will postpone its execution until after wait milliseconds have elapsed
  since the last time it was invoked.

  Pass `true` for the `immediate` parameter to cause debounce to trigger
  the function on the leading edge instead of the trailing edge of the wait
  interval. Useful in circumstances like preventing accidental double-clicks
  on a "submit" button from firing a second time.

  The debounced function returned has a property 'clear' that is a 
  function that will clear any scheduled future executions of your function.

  The debounced function returned has a property 'flush' that is a 
  function that will immediately execute the function if and only if execution is scheduled,
  and reset the execution timer for subsequent invocations of the debounced
  function.
