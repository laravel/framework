# Laravel 4 Beta Change Log

## Beta 2

- Migrated to ircmaxell's [password-compat](http://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat) library for PHP 5.5 forward compatibility on hashes. No backward compatibility breaks.
- Inflector migrated to L4. Eloquent models now assume their table names if one is not specified. New helpers `str_plural` and `str_singular`.
- Improved `Route::controller` so that `URL::action` may be used with RESTful controllers.
- Added model binding to routing engine via `Route::model` and `Route::bind`.
- Added `missingMethod` to base Controller, can be used to handle catch-all routes into the controller.
- Fixed bug with Redis data retrieval that caused server to hang.
- Implemented `ArrayableInterface` and `JsonableInterface` on `MessageBag`.
- Fixed bug where `hasFile` returned `true` when `file` returned `null`.
- Changed default PDO case constant to `CASE_NATURAL`.
- `DB::table('foo')->truncate()` now available on all supported databases.
